ðŸ“¢ Important Notice Regarding Antivirus False Positive

Some users have reported that their antivirus software flags our app with the detection name:
Trojan.Malware.300983.susgen

We want to reassure you that this is a false positive. Our app does not contain any malicious code. These types of warnings often occur when antivirus software misidentifies safe applications, especially those developed by independent developers or small teams who haven't purchased an expensive code-signing certificate.

ðŸ”’ What is a Code-Signing Certificate?
Itâ€™s a digital certificate that helps verify the identity of a software publisher. While it can reduce false positives, it costs between Â£400 and Â£1000 per year, which is not feasible for many open-source or indie developers.

ðŸ’¡ What You Can Do
If you trust the source (our official GitHub repository), you can safely whitelist the app in your antivirus software or allow it to run. We always recommend downloading the app only from our official channels.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!
